OPTIONS
   1. Input/output

      -f matrix_file                   Input matrix file with initial set of molecular orbitals. 
                                       The first line contains the number of matrix files in the 
                                       input, and then on each line is a separate matrix file.

      --print-level print_level        Verbosity of output. Default print level is 1. Options
                                       0-4.

      --print-veldip                   Compute and print the velocity gauge dipole along with the
                                       length gauge dipole.

   2. Determinant expansion 

      --sub-levels substitutions       Substitution levels permitted in truncated CI calculation. 
                                       The default is all single substitutions.

                                       Example: [1,2] specifies single and double substitutions.

      --core-orbitals core-orbitals    Number of occupied orbitals to exclude from the truncated 
                                       CI determinant expansion.

      --virt-orbitals virt-orbitals    Number of virtual orbitals to exclude from the truncated 
                                       CI determinant expansion.

      --active-space active_space      Defines orbital space in which to construct initial basis
                                       determinant expansion through orbital swaps. For each input
                                       solution the number of electrons and orbitals in the active
                                       space should be specified.

                                       Example: [4,4:3,6] specifies an expansion of four electrons
                                       in four orbitals in the first input orbitals and an
                                       expansion of three electrons in six orbitals in the second
                                       input orbitals.

      --alter alter_list               Changes the order of orbitals in the input molecular
                                       orbitals. Alterations to each input orbitals should be
                                       colon separated and the two orbital numbers to be swapped
                                       should be separated by a if two alpha orbitals will be
                                       swapped, or b if two beta orbitals will be swapped.
                                       Different orbital swaps should be comma separated.

                                       Example: [3a4,2b4:5a6] swaps alpha orbitals 3 and 4 and
                                       beta orbitals 2 and 4 in input orbitals 1, and swaps alpha
                                       orbitals 5 and 6 in input orbitals 2.

      --ci-type type_string            Specifies the type of configuration interaction. Options

                                          determinant expansion specified by sub-levels option.
                                          Only one matrix file should be specified in the input 
                                          file is expected and additional inputs will result in 
                                          an error.
                                       2) ocas

                                          matrix file should be specified in the input file is 
                                          expected and additional inputs will result in an 
                                          error.
                                       3) noci

                                          determinant expansion specified by matrix files 
                                          listed in input file.
                                       4) hci (not yet implemented)

                                          orbitals in each matrix file in the input file, which 
                                          generally leads to mixed orthogonal and nonorthogonal 
                                          determinants. Substitution levels are specified by 
                                          sub-levels option.
                                       5) hcas (not yet implemented)
                                          Perform a hybrid complete active space determinant 
                                          expansion. That is, an orthogonal complete active 
                                          space determinant expansion on molecular orbitals in 
                                          each matrix file in the input file, which generally 
                                          leads to mixed orthogonal and nonorthogonal 
                                          determinants. Active spaces are specified by active-
                                          space option.

   3. Hamiltonian matrix construction

      --direct                         Avoid the use of 2ERIs in nonorthogonal code. Gaussian 
                                       is required if requested.

      --gauss-exe gaussian_executable  Path, executable and command line flags for Gaussian
                                       executable used when running Gaussian jobs from within
                                       the program.

      --do-proc-mem                    Request %mem and %nproc lines be added to the output
                                       Gaussian input files if doing direct matrix elements.

      --mem mem                        Amount of memory to be included in %mem output to
                                       Gaussian input files. --do-proc-mem must be set.
                                       Default is 8GB. Note input is not checked for validity.

      --ncpu ncpu                      Number of processors to be included in %nproc output
                                       to Gaussian input files. --do-proc-mem must be set.
                                       Default is 2. Note input is not checked for validity.

      --keep-inters                    Do not delete intemediate files used in the calculation.
                                       Default is to delete intermediate files.

   4. Initial conditions

      --initial-state weight_vector    Initial state for simulation. For a pure state, the  
                                       desired root can be input as a single integer. For a 
                                       mixed state, each non-zero weighted root should be 
                                       included along wih the specified weight (Default is
                                       a ground state population of 1.0). Note that the input 
                                       vector is normalized regardless of input values.
                                   
                                       Example: [1,0.5:2,0.5] specifies an initial state with 
                                       50% weight on the lowest root and 50% weight on the 
                                       fourth root.

                                          E(t) = E(0)*sin(w(t-t0))*H(t-t0)
                                       4) transform limited
                                          E(t) = E(0)*exp(-(t-t0)^2/2*sigma^2)*sin(omega*(t-t0))
                                       5) chirped pulse
                                          E(t) = E(0)*exp(-(t-t0)^2/2*sigma^2)*
                                                   sin((omega+beta(t-t0))*(t-t0))
                                       6) cos squared
                                          E(t) = E(0)*(cos((pi/(2*sigma))*(sigma-t+t0)))**2*
                                                   sin(omega*(t-t0))*H(t-t0)*H(sigma-t)

      --field-vector field_vector      Field polarization vector. Should be vector of length
                                       three. The default is to orient on the z-axis. Note that
                                       the initial vector is normalized regardless of input 
                                       values.

                                       Example: [0.5,0,-0.5] specifies a field orientation of 
                                       1/sqrt(2) along the x axis and -1/sqrt(2) along the z axis.

      --field-size field_magnitude     Maximum magnitude of field vector in simulation (au)
                                       (default is 0.005 au = 25.7 MV/cm = 1.752 W/m^2 in free
                                       space conditions).

      --t0 time                        Time for either pulse onset or pulse maximum depending on
                                       pulse type (default is 0.0 au).

      --sigma width                    Pulse width for pulse shapes that use it (default is 0.5 au). 

      --beta shift                     Chirp parameter for pulse shapes that use it (default is 3.0 au). 

   6. Simulation parameters
 
      --tcf-start time                 Compute time correlation function starting from input time. The 
                                       Fourier transform of this function when the start time is the time 
                                       step after the delta pulse provides the absorption spectrum.

      --time-step time_step            Time step for simulation in au (default 0.1 au = 2.42 as).

      --simulation-time time           Total simulation time in au (default is 100.0 au = 2.42 fs).

      --save steps                     Save the density to a matrix file each time the specified interval
                                       of steps is reached, starting with the first step. A value of zero
                                       (default) means that no densities are saved.

   7. Nuclear potential 

      --nuclear-step file_name         File giving increment to nuclear coordinates and nuclear charge for
                                       each step in the nuclear potential. 

                                       WARNING! The current implementation overwrites the input matrix files.

      --nuclear-time nuclear_time      Time step for each change in nuclear geometry in au (default is equal
                                       to simulation time so no nuclear step is taken).

      --nuclear-start nuclear_start    Time at which to start the nuclear steps so the first step is taken
                                       at nuclear_start+nuclear_time. Default is 0.0 au.

      --maxNucSteps nuclear_steps      Maximum number of nuclear steps. Can be used to specify the number of
                                       times the nuclear increment is applied.

      --nuclear-update nuclear_update  Method for updating the state weights after a nuclear step. Options 
                                       are:
                                       1) sudden (default)
                                          Reweight eigenstates so that wavefunction is the same after the 
                                          nuclear step, i.e. the wavefunction does not have time to respond
                                          to the perturbation.
                                       2) adiabatic
                                          Keep eigenstate weights the same after the nuclear step, i.e. the
                                          perturbation is slow enough that the wavefunction adapts to stay 
                                          in the same state.

   8. Vibration simulation

                                       corresponding to the vibration frequency of interest. It then operates 
                                       on the values of dx, dy, and dz to give new values that it writes to 
                                       nuc.txt. For usage; type '$python ~/TDCIS/frequency_sim.py --help' with 
                                       no quotation marks
                                       The script is written to use the most basic python version
      
      --frequencies-file               File containing dx dy and dz values adapted from freq gaussian 
                                       calculation. Its format is as follows:
                                       line 1: number of atoms; e.g. 10

      --vibration-frequency            This is a real value of the frequency (in wavenumbers) of the 
                                       vibration mode that you want to simulate

                                       Example is provided for vibration simulation section.
                                       Its in 'vimExample' and 'run' has all the commands required

      --vibration-amplitude            real value specifying the vibration/rotation displacement

NOTES
      Compilation of this program requires the MQC library (https://github.com/MQCPack/mqcPack)
      and the gauopen utility (http://gaussian.com/g16/gauopen.zip) and compilation with the
      f08 standard.

      Compilation tested using: gfortran 9.2.0

      Note that subroutine Wr_LCBuf needs modifying in gauopen/qcmatrix.F as follows:
        line 58:       LenBX = (LenBuf/(2*abs(NR)))*abs(NR)
        line 60:       Call Wr_CBuf(IU,NTot*abs(NR),LenBX,X)

      Documentation generated with robodoc. To update documentation edit robodoc.rc to
      determine documentation output type and then run robodoc at the command line in the
      main directory.
